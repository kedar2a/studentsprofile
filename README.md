# Students Profile

The main objective of this project is to, create a django application from scratch in hierarchical, simpler way. When I was new to Python-Django family, it takes the time for me to understand the things. No doubt Django documentations are at it's best with great depth. But still it's difficult for newbie to grasp quickly. After long time familarity with this family, I thought to put one simple flow for creating the Django project. I purposely added screenshot at the end of each minute step, which can be matched by developer while trying the steps. That's all for the goal of this project.
