# Students Profile

The main objective of this project is to create a django application from scratch in hierarchical and simpler way. When I was new to Python - Django family, it takes the time for me to understand the things. No doubt Django documentations are at it's best with the great depth. But still it's difficult for newbie to grasp quickly. After long time familarity with Django, I thought to put one simple flow for creating the Django project. I purposely added screenshot/s at the end of each minute step, which can be cross checked by developer while trying these steps. That's all for the goal of this project.
